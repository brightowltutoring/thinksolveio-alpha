		body: "Jon explained the mechanics behind every question I had trouble with in thorough detail. If I had difficulty understanding his explanation, he would use another way to represent his knowledge such as drawing pictures and using diagrams. he taught me measurements, mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, nuclear and thermal physics. He was also a big help with my physics IA! He also made my solution space a place where I could look back if I've forgotten something."
